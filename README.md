# Introduction:
The project is related to extracting knowledge from the car insurance data from an insurance company. In this project we are going to analyze the real world business data. The problem that will be solved by this project is mentioned below.

# Prediction:
Need to predict the customers who would be interested to buy the car insurance product.
# Explanation:
Need to explain why such prediction is necessary to understand the potential customers.
# Data Set:
This project consists of three data-set.
## TICDATA2000.txt:
This is the training data-set having 5822 rows and 86 columns, containing customer records. Out of the 86 columns first 43 columns are Sociology-Demographic data for the customers and rest are product ownership information. The Socio-Demographic data is derived from the zip code information that implies that areas with same zip codes have same Socio-Demographic attributes. Attribute 86: “CARAVAN” is the target variable.
## TICEVAL2000.txt:
This is the test data set having 4000 rows and 85 columns. This data set does not have Attribute 86: “CARAVAN”.
## TICTGTS2000.txt:
This data set has the information about the customers who actually bought the car insurance, which is the basis to evaluate our prediction accuracy.
